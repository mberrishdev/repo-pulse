## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All configuration is managed via `public/config.json`.  
**Example:**

```json
{
  "azureDevOps": {
    "baseUrl": "https://dev.azure.com",
    "organization": "your-org",
    "project": "your-project",
    "personalAccessToken": "<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "name": "Repo1",
      "url": "/your-org/your-project/_git/Repo1",
      "pipelineId": "123",
      "branch": "master",
      "status": ""
    }
  ],
  "renovate": {
    "enabled": true,
    "botName": "renovate[bot]",
    "autoMerge": false
  }
}
```

- **baseUrl:** Your Azure DevOps base URL (usually `https://dev.azure.com`)
- **personalAccessToken:** Required for all API calls. **Never expose this in production frontend code!**
- **repositories:** List of repos to manage, with their pipeline IDs and default branches.
- **renovate:** Renovate bot settings.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

> **Do NOT expose your Personal Access Token (PAT) in production frontend code.**  
> Azure DevOps REST APIs do not support CORS, so all API calls requiring a PAT must be proxied through a secure backend.
